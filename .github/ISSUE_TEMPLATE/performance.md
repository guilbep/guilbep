## Prework

- [ ] Read and agree to the code of conduct
- [ ] If there is already a relevant issue, whether open or closed, comment on the existing thread instead of posting a new issue.
- [ ] Post a minimal reproducible example so the maintainer can troubleshoot the problems you identify. A reproducible example is:
  - [ ] **Runnable**
  - [ ] **Minimal**: reduce runtime wherever possible and remove complicated details that are irrelevant to the issue at hand.

## Description

Please describe the performance issue.

## Benchmarks
